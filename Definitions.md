- **POCO** (Plain Old CLR Object)
    ~ A class that has *no methods* and whose properties/fields are the built-in data types in the CLR (Common-Language Runtime).

- **DTO** (Data Transfer Object)
    ~ A class that has *no methods* and whose properties/fields are any combination of CLR, POCO, and DTO types.

- **CBO** (Custom Business Object)
    ~ A class with methods and properties/fields representing a "contained" business concern, such as validating its property values and performing business-specific operations on its state.
